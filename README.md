# QDM magnetic microscopy dataset of a speleothem from Morocco

High-resolution magnetic map of a stalagmite sample from Wintimdouine Cave,
Morocco, created using Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) measurements at Harvard
University. The data were collected to explore the magnetic remanence
properties of hematite and magnetite within the sample, providing insight into
past geomagnetic field variations recorded in cave deposits.

Available as both a compressed netCDF file as well as the original Matlab file
(`.mat`) in the Harvard format.

## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

Version 1:

* Convert from Matlab format to compressed NetCDF.
* Add metadata to the NetCDF file.
* Rename the original Matlab file.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
