# QDM magnetic microscopy dataset of a speleothem from Morocco - MAT-file

This dataset presents a high-resolution magnetic map of a stalagmite sample from Wintimdouine Cave, Morocco, created using Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) measurements at Harvard University. The data were collected to explore the magnetic remanence properties of hematite and magnetite within the sample, providing insight into past geomagnetic field variations recorded in cave deposits.

### Methodology

- **Measurement Equipment**: Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM)
- **Sample Dimensions**: 1410 Î¼m x 2256 Î¼m
- **Grid Spacing**: 2.35 Î¼m
- **Sensor-Sample Distance**: ~5 Î¼m
- **Total Data Points**: ~576,000
- **Magnetic Measurement Mode**: Projected Magnetic Microscopy (PMM)  
- **Data Conversion**: Magnetic field values converted to the vertical component, \( b_z \), across the grid.

### Sample Characteristics

The stalagmite sample carries magnetic remanence dominated by hematite and magnetite grains:
- **IRM Pulse Fields Applied**: Two isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) pulse fields were applied:
  - 2.7 T in the +Y direction (high coercivity, aligning hematite grains).
  - 0.3 T in the -Y direction (low coercivity, aligning magnetite grains).

### Usage Notes

This dataset can be used for detailed analysis of spatial variations in magnetic remanence, aiding studies in:
- Paleomagnetic research
- Environmental magnetism
- Cave sediment studies

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
